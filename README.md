# JurisGPT: an AI-powered Summarization System for the Supreme Court Rulings of the Mendoza province, Argentina

The project aims to develop an MVP for a summarization system that utilizes the rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. Users will have the capability to produce summaries based on the court's jurisprudence. The system employs several technologies such as LangChain, a local LLM Vicuna 7B, and Chroma DB, among others, and will be deployed on the AWS cloud. This comprehensive solution will enable efficient and accurate retrieval of information from the court's rulings, enhancing access to legal knowledge.
