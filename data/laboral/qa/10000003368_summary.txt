 The Supreme Court of Argentina has issued a ruling in the case "Manrique" (No. 13-04491180-3/1), which addresses the constitutionality of a provision in the Labor Code regarding the time limit for filing an appeal against a labor administrative decision. The Court found that the provision is unconstitutional and inconsistent with the National Labor Code, as it establishes a shorter time limit for filing an appeal than the Code provides.

The Court's decision was based on the principle of equality before the law and the need to ensure that all workers have equal access to justice. The Court recognized that the provision in question had been challenged in previous cases, but found that these challenges were not sufficient to justify its constitutionality. The Court also noted that the provision had been delegated to the jurisdiction of the administrative authority, but that this did not absolve the judiciary of its responsibility to ensure that the law is applied consistently and fairly.

In addition, the Court analyzed the case "Shell-Mex Argentina Ltda. vs. Poder Ejecutivo de Mendoza," in which the Supreme Court declared a local decision unconstitutional that altered the time limit for a civil action regulated by the Civil Code. The Court found that this decision was relevant to the case at hand, as it established that the National Labor Code has exclusive jurisdiction over labor matters and that any provision that conflicts with this jurisdiction is unconstitutional.

Finally, the Court resolved a case in which a provincial law established a shorter time limit for filing an appeal against a denial of repetition by the creditor, which conflicted with the provisions of the Civil Code. The Court found that this law was also unconstitutional, as it imposed a shorter time limit than that established by the Civil Code and therefore invaded the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Legislature.

In summary, the Supreme Court's decision in "Manrique" (No. 13-04491180-3/1) was based on the principle of equality before the law and the need to ensure that all workers have equal access to justice. The Court found that a provision in the Labor Code regarding the time limit for filing an appeal against a labor administrative decision was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the National Labor Code, and therefore declared it null and void.
