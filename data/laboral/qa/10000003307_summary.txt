 The Supreme Court of Argentina has issued a ruling in the case of Experta ART SA vs. Rogelio Marcelo, in which the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant was responsible for the accident that gave rise to the lawsuit, and ordered the defendant to pay damages to the plaintiff.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the accident did not occur, and that he may have been negligent in the production of the alleged accident. Additionally, the court found that the defendant was employed by Latino Consult S.A., a company that had a contract of affiliation with Experta ART S.A., the plaintiff.

The court also ruled that the Resolution 414/99 of the Superintendency of Labor Risks is unconstitutional, as it does not provide a sufficient tribute for the damages caused by the accident.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of Argentina has established a new precedent in this case, which may have implications for future jurisprudence in similar cases. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove one's innocence in a legal dispute, and the need for employers to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their employees.
